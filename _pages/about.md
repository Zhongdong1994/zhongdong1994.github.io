Hello! I'm Zhongdong Liu (刘中东) — thank you for visiting my personal website. I’m currently a Software Engineer at Meta, where I work on datacenter design and configuration. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or have any questions.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr.Bo Ji](https://people.cs.vt.edu/boji/). My research interests lie in the modeling, analysis, control, optimization, and learning of computer and network systems, with a particular focus on information-update systems.

Before joining Virginia Tech, I earned my B.S. degree in Mathematics (with Honors) from Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China, in 2016.
