Hello, I'm Zhongdong (Nicholas) Liu, a fourth year CS PhD student at Virginia Tech advised by [Dr.Bo Ji](https://people.cs.vt.edu/boji/). My research interests include the modeling, analysis, control, optimization, and learning of computer and network systems. I have a particular interest in the information-update systems.
