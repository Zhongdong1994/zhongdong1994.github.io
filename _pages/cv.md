  * The Age-of-Information (AoI) is a fundamentally novel performance metric recently proposedfor measuring the freshness of information in information-update systems, which is shown to be significantly different to existing timeliness metrics such as delay and throughput. 
  * Through this project, we try to analyze AoI in various real-time systems and networks and propose AoI-efficient scheduling policies to improve the information freshness of those systems.
